/**
 * Inbound-content resolution for the comm-bridge message handler.
 *
 * Problem this solves
 * -------------------
 * A cws-comm WS "message" frame carries only metadata (id / conversation_id /
 * sender_id), NOT the message body. The body is fetched separately via
 * GET /conversations/{conv}/messages/{id}. When that GET fails (or returns a
 * payload with no usable body), the old code merged `{ ...notification }` with
 * an empty/`null` detail and forwarded a metadata-only, EMPTY message to the
 * agent. The real text only showed up later — out of order — via the next
 * /sync catch-up. That is the bug.
 *
 * Behavior implemented here (owner-approved spec)
 * ----------------------------------------------
 *  1. Retry the content fetch once (configurable) — a transient GET failure is
 *     the common case, and a single re-GET usually succeeds.
 *  2. If content still can't be resolved (detail null / no usable body after
 *     all attempts), return a `skip-empty` decision so the caller can:
 *       - NOT forward an empty message,
 *       - NOT advance read-state / the /sync cursor for it (so it stays
 *         "unconsumed" and is re-pulled by the next /sync catch-up in order),
 *       - on the realtime WS path only, force a WS reconnect (which triggers
 *         the existing reconnect → /sync catch-up auto-fetch).
 *  3. Reconnect-storm guard: a frame that arrived via the /sync catch-up replay
 *     (`notification._via === 'sync'`) must NOT force another disconnect
 *     mid-sweep (that would abort/loop the catch-up). It still retries, still
 *     skips the empty forward, and still leaves the cursor un-advanced — the
 *     existing exponential reconnect backoff + un-advanced cursor is the safety
 *     net there. So `forceReconnect` is true ONLY for the realtime path.
 */

/**

 * any media/attachment reference. A media-only message (image/file with no
