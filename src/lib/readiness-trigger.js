/**
 * Event-driven runtime-metrics trigger.
 *
 * WHY: `runtime.state` (IDLE / BUSY / OFFLINE …) is what the platform reads to
 * decide whether an Agent can be talked to, but it only travels upward on the
 * runtime-metrics tick — 60s by default, plus a 15s initial delay. A freshly
 * provisioned Agent can therefore sit "greyed out" in the UI for up to a minute
 * after it is genuinely able to work. This watcher closes that window by firing
 * one extra report the moment the gate-relevant state actually changes.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A CHANGE — deliberately NOT every state transition. The local
 * execution state flaps between busy and idle constantly while an agent works
 * (observed in the readiness logs: busy → idle_too_brief → busy within seconds).
 * Reporting on every flap would turn a 1/min PUT into a continuous stream for a
 * working agent, which is a worse problem than the latency it fixes. So the
 * fingerprint is only what the platform's chat gate can act on:
 *
 *   - `stage` — how far provisioning has provably got (see READINESS_STAGES in
 *               agent-readiness.js). `ready` and `observable` are derived from
 *               it, so comparing the stage subsumes both.
 *
 * busy↔idle does not move the stage (both are `session_ready`), so an agent
 * grinding through a long task produces no extra reports.
 *
 * The periodic tick is left exactly as it is: this only adds reports, never
 * removes them, so a missed edge still heals on the next tick.
