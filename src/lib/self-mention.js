/**
 * Self-mention detection for group messages.
 *
 * @-mentions are resolved purely by stable member ID. cws-comm/cws-core treat
 * a message's structured `mentions[]` array (member UUIDs, `mentioned_id` per
 * entry) as the ONLY mention source and do NOT parse @names from the message
 * text (cws-core message.go: "cws-comm does not parse @names from the message
 * text; this array is the only mention source"). So an agent is @-mentioned
 * iff its own member_id appears in that array.
 *
 * This is what fixes issue #85 / cws-comm #329: "@luna.coco" carries
 * luna.coco's member_id, so a bare "luna" agent is simply not in the array and
 * is never woken — no fragile text/name matching is involved, so there is no
 * dot/hyphen/substring collision class to get wrong.
 *
 * @all handling comes for free: cws-comm EXPANDS @all/@all_agents into one row
 * per targeted member, each carrying that member's real `mentioned_id` (plus an
 * `is_mention_all` marker used only for @-chip rendering). So "@所有Agent"
 * yields a row with this agent's own member_id → matched; "@所有人" yields rows
 * for human members only → this agent's id is absent → not matched. The
 * `is_mention_all` flag is therefore NOT a matching signal: keying off it would
 * add no real @all_agents coverage (the id is already present) while causing
 * agents to answer human-only "@所有人" broadcasts in multi-human groups.
