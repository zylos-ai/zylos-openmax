/**
 * Auto-upgrade — periodically check GitHub for new releases and upgrade openmax
 * via a dedicated, on-demand PM2 app (the "upgrader").
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Timer fires (first check after intervalMs, then every intervalMs).
 *   2. Fetch latest GitHub release tag via REST API.
 *   3. Compare against current package.json version (semver).
 *   4. If newer: write a 'running' marker, start the executor as its OWN PM2
 *      app (`zylos-openmax-upgrader`) via `pm2 start`, and only notify owners
 *      once the start succeeded (a failed start writes a failed marker and
 *      notifies of the failure instead).
 *   5. Because a pm2-started process is parented to the PM2 daemon (a sibling of
 *      zylos-openmax, not a descendant), the `pm2 stop zylos-openmax` inside
 *      `zylos upgrade openmax` can never kill it — no "suicide" mid-upgrade.
 *      The executor snapshots the current version, verifies the new version,
 *      rolls back to the snapshot on failure, writes a terminal marker, ensures
 *      the service is running, and removes its own PM2 entry. PM2 acts as its
 *      watchdog: the upgrader runs with autorestart capped at max_restarts, so
 *      an executor that dies unexpectedly (OOM, kill) is relaunched within
 *      seconds; the relaunch detects the foreign pid claim in the marker and
 *      recovers (restore + restart openmax) instead of re-running the upgrade.
 *      This matters because the detection timer below lives INSIDE openmax —
 *      if openmax is left stopped, no future check cycle can ever rescue it.
 *   6. On the next startup / check, notifyUpgradeComplete reads the terminal
 *      marker and DMs owners. A leftover upgrader entry found on a later check
 *      is treated as a zombie: cleaned up and (if its marker was still
 *      'running') recorded as a failed version so it is never retried into a
 *      loop. An upgrader that is still ONLINE is never killed from here.
 *
 * Config (all optional, in config.json top level):
 *   autoUpgrade.enabled        — boolean, default false
 *   autoUpgrade.intervalHours  — number,  default 24
