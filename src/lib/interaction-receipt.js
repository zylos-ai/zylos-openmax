/**
 * Reply-target resolution for `interaction_receipt` messages.
 *
 * When someone answers a display card, cws-comm posts an INTERACTION_RECEIPT
 * into the read-only `interaction_center` system DM — NOT into the conversation
 * the card was posted to. So `msg.conversation_id` is that system DM, and the
 * conversation we must answer in is carried in the receipt body as
 * `content.body.origin.conversation_id` (a bare UUID, same format as
 * `msg.conversation_id`).
 *
 * Contract: cws-docs `interaction-receipt-contract.md`. It deliberately deviates
 * from `card-choice-interaction-refactor.md` §5.4/§5.5, which named the fields
 * `conversation_uri` / `message_uri` — the implementation carries bare ids with
 * no scheme prefix.
 *
 * Field names follow cws-comm's emitter (`61f5ed2`). Resolution is defensive
 * throughout regardless: a receipt whose shape this code does not recognize
 * falls back to the message's own conversation rather than being dropped,
 * because a dropped message is silent and a misrouted reply is not.
