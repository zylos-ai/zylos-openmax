/**
 * Build the body for `POST /conversations/{id}/interaction-requests`
 * (interaction_type=choice) from the arguments `comm.send_card` accepts.
 *
 * This replaces building a `cws.card.v1` body locally. The agent now states
 * what it wants — a title, a body, the choices — and cws-comm builds the card,
 * which is why nothing here names an operation, a URL, a handler or an option
 * id.
 *
 * 🔴 Option ids are NOT ours to choose any more. cws-comm generates them and
 * returns them in `action_ids`, positionally aligned with the options sent. A
 * caller that used to pass `id` and match on it later is rejected loudly here
 * rather than having that binding silently dropped — losing it would make the
 * answer unreadable at exactly the moment it arrives.
 *
 * 🔴 No length or count caps here, deliberately, and this reverses what
 * buildDisplayCard did. Every such rule already exists in cws-comm — the block
 * allowlist, the option cap, the label length, the duplicate-label check — and
 * restating one locally creates a second ruling point that drifts. The
 * stricter direction is the worse one: a local cap tighter than cws-comm's
 * makes a range the server accepts unreachable, with an error that blames the
 * caller. The cws-core edge made the same call for the same reason.
