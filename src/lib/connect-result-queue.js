/**
 * Durable queue for undelivered connect-results.
 *
 * A channel binding stays `pending` until its result is recorded, and a pending
 * binding is exactly what leaves the workspace UI spinning with no way to
 * retry. The connector already retries the POST with backoff
 * (channel-connector.js), but a result that outlives those attempts — a longer
 * outage, or a crash/restart mid-flight — must not be dropped: the channel is
 * connected and serving while the record says otherwise.
 *
 * So anything the connector could not deliver is written to disk and re-sent
 * until it lands. Deliberately a plain JSON file, not a database: the queue is
 * tiny, write amplification is irrelevant at one entry per connect command, and
 * a file survives a restart, which is the whole point.
 *
 * Pure logic + injectable I/O so the retry/resend path is unit-testable — the
 * previous version lived inline in comm-bridge.js, where it could not be tested
 * and shipped with an undefined path constant that crashed the service on boot.
