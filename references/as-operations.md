# AS Operations Guide

**Purpose**: ArtifactStore operations — byte upload of files / media + download URL resolution. Covers the two upload paths, conversation attachments (IM mode) and KB file nodes (KB mode), as well as pre-signed URL resolution and local download of artifacts.

**When to load this document**:

- To send a local file as a conversation attachment (image / PDF / audio recording, etc.), use `as.upload` in IM mode (with `conversationId`)
- To archive a file into the KB tree, use `as.upload` in KB mode (without `conversationId`, optional `parentId`) or `kb.upload`
- Received a reference in the form `artifact://<id>` and need to get a pre-signed URL (`as.url` for a single one / `as.resolve` for a batch)
- To download the bytes of a remote artifact locally for analysis (`as.download`)
- To troubleshoot why a file "uploaded successfully but can't be sent" or "was attached to the KB but search can't find it" (almost always the wrong choice between IM vs KB mode)

**Out of scope for this document**:

- KB page / folder / tree node operations → `references/kb-operations.md`
- Referencing attachments when sending messages → `references/comm-operations.md` (the `content` field of `comm.send`)
- Task / Issue / Blueprint workflow → `references/tm-operations.md`
- **artifact CRUD** (list / get / update / delete / abort) → **retired in v5**, not exposed by the cws-core BFF; bytes are immutable, re-upload to change content

**Prerequisites**:

- IM upload requires a `conversationId` first (obtained from `comm.create_dm` / `comm.list_conversations`)
- The `parentId` (folder node id) for KB upload comes from `kb.tree_roots` / `kb.node_children`; if omitted, it attaches to the KB root
- `as.url` / `as.download` require an already-obtained `artifactId` or `artifact://` URI (usually from a previous `as.upload` response, or a reference someone else sent)
- For the full parameter dependency tree, see [`SKILL.md` Efficiency Shortcuts > Parameter Resolution](../SKILL.md)

> Layer 3 operations reference. This document maintains 1:1 correspondence with the `src/cli/as.js` dispatch table.
> The authoritative paths are per the cws-core OpenAPI: `https://zylos01.jinglever.com/cws-core/openapi.json`

CLI location: `src/cli/as.js`
Invocation: `node src/cli/as.js <command> '<json>'`

> `as.js` has a **dual role** within zylos-openmax:
> - As a CLI: the Agent explicitly calls `node src/cli/as.js <cmd>`
> - As a library: `scripts/send.js`, `src/comm-bridge.js`, and `src/cli/kb.js` all `import` `uploadMedia` / `getMediaUrl` / `downloadMedia` from this file — the repo's **only** entry point for upload / download implementation
>
> Everything involving binary bytes goes through here; do not write a second copy.

Status: ✅ All v5 paths go through the cws-core BFF (`/api/v1/...`), and the underlying cws-core then does connect-RPC to cws-as.

## Environment Variables

## ⚠ Which upload path do you take? IM or KB?

**`as.upload` is a dual-mode entry point that decides which server-side path to take based on whether `conversationId` is present. Choosing wrong will fail.**

| Your purpose | Take IM upload or KB upload | How to call the CLI |
|---|---|---|
| **Send images / files in a chat / conversation** (user to agent / agent to user) | **IM upload** | `as.upload {filePath, conversationId, mediaType:"image"/"file"}` — **must include conversationId** |
| **Archive material to the KB** (project deliverables, research note attachments) | **KB upload** | `kb.upload {kbId, filePath, parentId?}` or `as.upload {filePath, parentId?}` — **without conversationId** |
| Agent outbound media message (`scripts/send.js [MEDIA:image]/path`) | **IM upload** (send.js selects automatically internally) | Directly `c4-send.js openmax "<conv>" "[MEDIA:image]/path"` |

### Server-side path comparison

| Mode | prepare endpoint | finalize endpoint | Returned fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IM** | `POST /api/v1/conversations/{cid}/uploads/prepare` | `POST /api/v1/conversations/uploads/finalize` | `{media_id, artifact_id, ...}` — used for the attachments of `comm.send` / `send.js` |
| **KB** | `POST /api/v1/uploads/prepare` (body includes `parent_id`) | `POST /api/v1/uploads/finalize` | `{node_id, artifact_id, tree_node, ...}` — a file node appears directly in the KB tree |

### What happens if you choose wrong

- **Want to send to a conversation but omit conversationId** → the CLI takes the KB path, the file attaches to the KB root directory, **does not appear in the chat box**, and the recipient sees nothing at all.
- **Want to archive to the KB but include conversationId** → the CLI takes the IM path, the artifact attaches to some conversation but is **not in the KB tree**, and neither KB retrieval nor `kb.search` can find it.
- **The artifact_id field is located differently in the two paths**; stuffing an IM `media_id` back into a KB operation as if it were a KB `node_id` (e.g. trying to use `kb.file_create artifactId=...`) will fail.

⚠️ This rule is strongly tied to the cws-comm / cws-kb backend architecture: on the IM path the artifact is bound to `conversation_id`, and on the KB path the artifact is bound to `org_id` + `kb_id`. Which path to take **can only be decided by the caller during the prepare stage**; switching later requires re-uploading.

## v5 three-step upload (every `as.upload` goes through this)

v5 splits uploads into two parallel flows by "purpose", sharing the same prepare → PUT → finalize rhythm, only with a different namespace for prepare / finalize. `as.upload` automatically selects the branch based on whether `conversationId` is present.

```

After the underlying cws-core receives the prepare / finalize, it calls cws-as via connect-RPC to complete artifact registration, SHA-256 verification, state machine advancement, etc.; the Agent side only sees these 3 steps on the cws-core BFF.

**Instant upload (`instant_upload`)**: the server looks up an existing active artifact by SHA-256, and on a match returns `instant_upload=true` directly, and the client skips the PUT step. When the Agent repeatedly uploads the same file (e.g. a screenshot), only the first time actually transfers the bytes.

**Old path retired**: in the contract-v4 era there was a single-flow upload that directly created an artifact via `POST /api/v1/artifacts` + wrapped it up via `POST /api/v1/artifacts/{id}/finalize`; this is deprecated in v5, and cws-core no longer registers these two routes. If you see this style of call in old code, migrate it to one of the two namespaces above.

## Command List

| Status | Command | Description | Input params | Real endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | `as.upload` | Dual-mode upload: with `conversationId` takes IM (conversation attachment), without takes KB (archive into the KB tree) | `{filePath, conversationId?, parentId?, mediaType?, contentType?, filename?}` | Dual-mode prepare/finalize (see the flow diagram above) |
| ✅ | `as.url` | Get the pre-signed download URL for a single artifact (attachment by default, optional inline preview) | `{artifactId\|uri, inline?}` | `POST /api/v1/artifacts/resolve` (takes the first `download_url`) |
| ✅ | `as.download` | `as.url` + byte GET, downloads to `~/zylos/components/openmax/media/<filename>` | `{artifactId\|uri, filename?}` | `as.url` + byte download to local |
| ✅ | `as.resolve` | Batch-resolve an array of `artifact://<id>` URIs to get pre-signed URLs (for inter-service calls) | `{uris:["artifact://<id>", ...], inline?}` | `POST /api/v1/artifacts/resolve` |

> **v5 BFF deliberately narrows the surface**: the old cws-as direct-connect artifact CRUD (`as.list / as.get / as.update / as.delete / as.abort`, corresponding to `GET\|PATCH\|DELETE /artifacts/{id}` + `POST /artifacts/{id}/abort`) is **no longer exposed through the cws-core BFF in v5** — these endpoints all return 404. If some capability needs to be restored later, you must first add the route in the cws-core BFF and then supplement the CLI. Artifact bytes are immutable; the normal workflow is for `as.upload` to create a new one, leaving the old one as history.

### `as.upload` details

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filePath` | string | **Required**, local absolute path |
| `conversationId` | uuid | **Set this → IM upload** (conversation attachment). The return contains `mediaId` for `comm.send` attachments |
| `parentId` | uuid | Only used for KB upload; the id of some folder node in the KB tree; if omitted, attaches to the KB root |
| `mediaType` | `image\|video\|audio\|voice\|file\|sticker` | Defaults to `file`; affects automatic MIME inference |
| `contentType` | string | Explicit MIME (overrides mediaType inference) |
| `filename` | string | Overrides the default filename (defaults to the filePath basename) |

**`conversationId` and `parentId` are mutually exclusive**: the IM path does not accept parent_id, and the KB path does not accept conversation_id. If both are passed, only `conversationId` takes effect (takes IM).

Return (IM mode):

```json
{
  "mediaId":       "art_01JDKF7M2NQRSTUVWXYZ012345",
  "artifactId":    "art_01JDKF7M2NQRSTUVWXYZ012345",
  "fileName":      "Q2-product-plan.pdf",
  "mimeType":      "application/pdf",
  "sizeBytes":     5242880,
  "instantUpload": false
}
```

KB mode additionally carries the `nodeId` + `treeNode` fields. `mediaId` is an alias for `artifactId` (backward compatibility for historical callers).

### `as.url` details

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artifactId` / `uri` | string | Required (accepts both the `artifact://<id>` form or a bare id) |
| `inline` | bool | true → uses inline disposition (in-browser embedded preview), false → attachment (force download) |

Returns `{url, expiresAt, contentType, contentLength, name}`. The URL is pre-signed (GCS / S3), with a default TTL of 15 minutes.

### `as.download` details

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artifactId` / `uri` | string | Required |
| `filename` | string | Landing filename, defaults to being taken from the artifact metadata |

Returns `{localPath}`, landing at `~/zylos/components/openmax/media/<filename>`. Internally = `as.url` + byte GET. Once the Agent gets `localPath`, it can be used as vision / file-read input.

### `as.resolve` details

Batch-resolves URIs in the `artifact://<id>` form into pre-signed download URLs, with Redis caching. Artifacts without permission do not 403 but return partial results (listed in the `failed` field).

```bash
node src/cli/as.js as.resolve '{"uris":["artifact://art_y","artifact://art_z"]}'
# -> {resolved:{...}, failed:[...]}
```

## Typical Flows

### Agent sends an image to the user (`scripts/send.js` takes this automatically)

```bash
# Outbound via C4:
node ~/zylos/.claude/skills/comm-bridge/scripts/c4-send.js \
  openmax '<conv-uuid>' '[MEDIA:image]/tmp/chart.png'
```

Inside `scripts/send.js`:

1. Parses `[MEDIA:image]/tmp/chart.png`
2. `as.uploadMedia('/tmp/chart.png', {mediaType:'image'})` → `{artifactId, mediaId, ...}`
3. `POST /api/v1/conversations/{id}/messages` body `{content:[{type:"image", body:"<media_id>"}], ...}`

### Agent views an image the user sent (`comm-bridge.js` takes this automatically)

WS pushes over a frame `{content:{media_id:"art_xyz"}, ...}`, inside comm-bridge:

1. `as.getMediaUrl("art_xyz")` → `{url:"https://storage.googleapis.com/.../signed?...", expiresAt}`
2. `as.downloadMedia(url, filename)` → `/home/cocoai/zylos/components/openmax/media/<file>`
3. Stuffs the local path into the C4 outbound text as `---- image: <localPath>` — the Agent sees the tag and automatically invokes vision

### Agent proactively calls the CLI

Usually **there is no need to call the as.js CLI directly**, because send.js and comm-bridge use it automatically. For manual management:

```bash
# Upload a PDF (KB mode: without conversationId)
node src/cli/as.js as.upload '{
  "filePath":"/tmp/report.pdf",
  "mediaType":"file"
}'
# -> {artifactId:"art_...", nodeId:"...", treeNode:{...}, instantUpload:false}

# Get a temporary link to share with someone
node src/cli/as.js as.url '{"artifactId":"art_..."}'
# -> {url:"https://...", expiresAt:"...", contentType:"...", name:"..."}

# Download locally for analysis
node src/cli/as.js as.download '{"artifactId":"art_..."}'
# -> {localPath:"/home/cocoai/zylos/components/openmax/media/<filename>"}

# Batch-resolve multiple URIs (for inter-service calls)
node src/cli/as.js as.resolve '{"uris":["artifact://art_a","artifact://art_b"]}'
# -> {resolved:{...}, failed:[...]}
```

## Selection Comparison

| Signal | Where to go |
| --- | --- |
| Content can be expressed in Markdown | KB Page (`kb.page_create`) |
| Binary (image / PDF / dataset) | `as.upload` + reference `media_id` in a message / KB |
| Large volume (MB / GB scale) | `as.upload` — uses pre-signed PUT to transfer directly to S3, bytes do not pass through the server |
| Temporary sharing into a conversation | `as.upload` (IM mode) + `comm.send` reference |
| Long-term referenced project deliverable | `as.upload` (KB mode) + register the `artifact://` URI on a KB page |
| Uploading the same file multiple times | The server automatically instant-uploads by SHA-256 (`instant_upload=true`) |

## Relationship with SKILL.md

This document is a Layer 3 sub-skill of [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md), responsible only for the **command mechanics** of the AS CLI (plus the unique "which path to choose" question of IM vs KB dual-mode). The following behavioral-surface content is **in SKILL.md** and is not repeated in this document:

| Want to see | Which section of SKILL.md to go to |
|---|---|
| Where to attach Lead experience distillation vs Worker task output | [Role Model](../SKILL.md) (the KB writing line) |
| How the output of `as.upload` is passed to a Task via `contextPageIds` | [Efficiency Shortcuts > Context Passing](../SKILL.md) |
| General error protection (do not curl direct-upload / do not bypass the CLI) | [Behavior Guardrails > Common Mistakes](../SKILL.md) |

## AS-specific Notes

- Artifacts are immutable; "modifying" = creating anew, leaving the old one as history
- `artifact_id` is in ULID form (`art_01JDKF...`, server-generated)
- Single-file size limit is 5 GB (exceeding returns `payload_too_large` 413)
- `mime_type` blacklist: executable files (`.exe` / `.sh`, etc.) return `unsupported_media_type` 415
- Pre-signed PUT URL TTL is 1 hour; on timeout you need to re-call the corresponding prepare endpoint (IM: `POST /api/v1/conversations/{cid}/uploads/prepare`; KB: `POST /api/v1/uploads/prepare`) to get a new `upload_token` + `upload_url`
- For large files (>100MB), cws-as automatically selects Multipart mode (`upload_mode:"multipart"`); the current `uploadMedia()` is still a single PUT, and the large-file scenario needs to be extended (marked TODO)
- `as.resolve` is for inter-service calls: artifacts without permission are skipped rather than 403, to avoid one failure dragging down the whole batch
- `media_id` / `artifactId` are synonyms (backward compatibility), and both are given in the return
- Choosing wrong between IM mode vs KB mode is the most common pitfall — different return fields + different downstream operation visibility, see "⚠ Which upload path do you take" above
