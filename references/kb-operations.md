# KB Operations Guide

**Purpose**: Knowledge Base operations — managing KB instances themselves, the directory tree (folder / file / page nodes), the page content + revision + trash three-state model, cross-page search, and file upload/download. Chain: `kb.js → cws-core (/api/v1) → cws-kb`.

**When to load this document**:

- Lead context assembly, searching the KB for reference material (`kb.search` + `kb.page_content`)
- Distilling experience / writing decision documents / taking notes into the KB (`kb.page_create` / `kb.page_content_write`)
- Organizing the KB directory (`kb.folder_create` / `kb.node_move` / `kb.node_rename`)
- Editing page content / rolling back to an old revision (`kb.page_update` / `kb.page_restore`)
- Soft-deleting a page / permanently deleting (the `kb.page_trash` → `kb.page_delete` three-state chain)
- Registering a file attachment into the KB tree (`kb.upload` or `as.upload` without conversationId)
- Batch-downloading project deliverables via pre-signed links (`kb.file_batch_download`)

**Out of scope for this document**:

- IM message attachments (going through a conversation): `as.upload` with `conversationId` → `references/as-operations.md`
- Task / Issue / Blueprint workflow → `references/tm-operations.md`
- Proactive messaging / creating groups → `references/comm-operations.md`
- Member / project / role directory → `references/core-operations.md`

**Prerequisites**:

- For any command that takes `kbId`, first run `kb.list` to confirm the KB exists (each org has 1 default KB, `is_default=true`)
- `kb.page_create` needs `parentId` (folder node id); get it from `kb.tree_roots` / `kb.node_children`
- `kb.page_update` / `kb.page_content_write` need `baseRevisionId`; first run `kb.page_get` to get the current `revision_id`

CLI location: `src/cli/kb.js`
Invocation: `node src/cli/kb.js <command> '<json>'`

Status: ✅ cws-core BFF already exposes it (all commands are reachable from the CLI).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COCO_API_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | cws-core BFF base address |
| `COCO_API_PREFIX` | `/api/v1` | Path prefix |
| `COCO_AUTH_TOKEN` | (empty) | Bearer token (shared with the tm / as / comm / core CLIs) |
| `COCO_ORG_ID` | (empty) | Overrides `config.org_id` |

## Data Model

```
Org (organization, the scope unit)
  └─ KB Config (1 per org, storage_quota / search toggle, etc.)
       │
       ├─ Tree Node (directory tree node)
       │    ├─ kind="folder"  → folder, has only child nodes
       │    └─ kind="page"    → page shell, linked to one Page
       │
       └─ Page (the content body, 1:1 with a tree node)
            └─ Revision (version, auto-incrementing from 1)
```

`org_id` is the scope unit for all KB operations — taken from `config.org_id` or the `COCO_ORG_ID` env var, configured at install time.

## Command List

### KB Collection

| Status | Command | Description | Input | Real Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | `kb.init` | Initialize the default KB for the current org (idempotent; repeated calls return the existing one) | `{}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs/init` |
| ✅ | `kb.list` | List the KB instances of the current org (currently usually 1 per org) | `{limit?, offset?}` | `GET /api/v1/kbs` |
| ✅ | `kb.create` | Create a new KB instance; `visibility` is one of `open` / `closed` / `private` (default closed); the slug is derived server-side from name | `{name, visibility?, description?, icon?}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs` |
| ✅ | `kb.get` | Get the details of a single KB instance | `{kbId}` | `GET /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}` |
| ✅ | `kb.update` | Edit KB metadata; `set_description` / `set_icon` are tri-state (explicit clear vs leave untouched)| `{kbId, name?, description?, setDescription?, visibility?, icon?, setIcon?}` | `PATCH /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}` |
| ✅ | `kb.delete` | Permanently delete a KB (physical delete, use with caution) | `{kbId}` | `DELETE /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}` |
| ✅ | `kb.archive` | Archive a KB (recoverable) | `{kbId}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/archive` |
| ✅ | `kb.unarchive` | Restore an archived KB back to active | `{kbId}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/unarchive` |

### Directory Tree

| Status | Command | Description | Input | Real Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | `kb.tree_roots` | List all top-level nodes under the KB root (folder / page / file) | `{kbId}` | `GET /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/roots` |
| ✅ | `kb.folder_create` | Create a folder node (the KB's only explicit node-creation entry point) | `{kbId, parentId?, name}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/folders` |
| ✅ | `kb.node_get` | Get node details (common to folder / page / file) | `{kbId, nodeId}` | `GET /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/nodes/{node_id}` |
| ✅ | `kb.node_breadcrumb` | Get a node's ancestor path (root → ... → current) | `{kbId, nodeId}` | `GET /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/nodes/{node_id}/breadcrumb` |
| ✅ | `kb.node_children` | List the direct child nodes under a given node | `{kbId, parentId}` | `GET /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/nodes/{parent_id}/children` |
| ✅ | `kb.node_move` | Move a node to another parent (within the same KB) | `{kbId, nodeId, parentId}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/nodes/{node_id}/move` |
| ✅ | `kb.node_rename` | Change a node's display name | `{kbId, nodeId, name}` | `PATCH /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/nodes/{node_id}/rename` |
| ✅ | `kb.node_delete` | Delete a node (a folder must be empty first; page / file go through their respective trash → delete) | `{kbId, nodeId}` | `DELETE /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/nodes/{node_id}` |

Node ID form: `tn-{uuid}`. A Page indirectly creates its corresponding tree node via `kb.page_create`, not through folder_create.

**⚠️ page_id ≠ node_id — when assembling a KB page link, the `?node=` parameter must use node_id, not page_id.** See the dedicated [Frontend Link Assembly](#frontend-link-assembly-agent-error-prone-must-read) section below.

### Pages

| Status | Command | Description | Input | Real Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | `kb.pages` | List pages (can filter by parent, paginated) | `{kbId, parentId?, cursor?, limit?, offset?}` | `GET /api/v1/pages` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_get` | Get page metadata (including the current revision_id) | `{pageId}` | `GET /api/v1/pages/{page_id}` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_create` | Create a page and return both its page metadata and `node_id` | `{kbId, title, parentId?, format?, body, message?}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/pages` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_update` | Edit any page attribute (title / parent / content are all allowed); optimistic concurrency, requires baseRevisionId | `{pageId, title?, path?, content?, baseRevisionId, commitMessage?}` | `PATCH /api/v1/pages/{page_id}` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_delete` | Permanent delete (physical delete); the page must first be in the `trashed` state, otherwise 404 | `{pageId}` | `DELETE /api/v1/pages/{page_id}` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_content` | Get the page's current body content | `{pageId}` | `GET /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/content` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_content_write` | Edit only the content body (a more specialized write entry point, suited to large edits); optimistic concurrency | `{pageId, body, message?, baseRevisionId?, autoSave?}` | `POST /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/content` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_revisions` | List all revisions of a page | `{pageId, limit?, offset?}` | `GET /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/revisions` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_revision` | Get the snapshot content of a specified revision | `{pageId, revisionId}` | `GET /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/revisions/{rev_id}` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_diff` | The diff between two revisions (unified format) | `{pageId, fromRevisionId, toRevisionId}` | `GET /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/diff` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_restore` | Roll back page content to an old revision (status unchanged, **not** trash-restore) | `{pageId, revisionId}` | `POST /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/restore-version` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_trash` | Soft delete (status → `trashed`, goes to the recycle bin) | `{pageId}` | `POST /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/trash` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_restore_trash` | Restore from the recycle bin (status → `active`, **not** a revision restore) | `{pageId}` | `POST /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/restore` |
| ✅ | `kb.pages_trashed` | List the current org's pages in the recycle bin | `{limit?, offset?}` | `GET /api/v1/pages/trashed` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_freeze` | Mark a page read-only (subsequent writes are rejected) | `{pageId}` | `POST /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/freeze` |
| ✅ | `kb.page_references` | List the locations referencing this page (other pages / context_page_ids, etc.) | `{pageId}` | `GET /api/v1/pages/{page_id}/references` |

Page ID form: `pg-{uuid}`. A Revision is a per-page auto-incrementing integer starting from 1.

**The difference between the two write entry points**:

- `kb.page_update` (`PATCH /pages/{pid}`): edits **any page attribute** (title, parent, content…); pass whichever ones you want in the body
- `kb.page_content_write` (`POST /pages/{pid}/content`): edits **only** the content body; more specialized semantics, suited to large follow-up edits by the Agent

Both support optimistic concurrency: first run `kb.page_get` to get `revision_id`, and pass it as `baseRevisionId` when writing; if the server detects a mismatch it returns 409 + the current revision_id, and the client re-reads, merges, then writes again.

**The two "restore" operations are not the same thing, and the Agent often confuses them**:

- `kb.page_restore` (`POST /pages/{pid}/restore-version`): **rolls back to an old revision**; the page's status is unchanged. Used to "undo the last N edits".
- `kb.page_restore_trash` (`POST /pages/{pid}/restore`): **restores from the recycle bin**, changing status from `trashed` back to `active`. Unrelated to revisions.
- The paths are similar but the semantics differ; **don't guess from the name** — when you encounter "restore", first figure out whether it is trash-restore or revision-restore.

**Three-state protection chain: trash → permanent_delete**:

- `kb.page_delete` is a **permanent delete** (physical delete), unrecoverable, so cws-kb requires the page to already be in the `trashed` state: you must first run `kb.page_trash` to throw the page into the recycle bin, then `kb.page_delete`.
- Calling `kb.page_delete` directly on an `active` page returns 404 from cws-kb (not the most honest semantics; this is cws-kb#193; but the semantic protection itself is retained, so don't work around it).
- Full flow: `page_create → ... → page_trash → page_delete`. If you want to undo partway through, use `page_restore_trash` to pull it back, and **when you delete again you must trash it once more first**.

### Search ⭐

| Status | Command | Description | Input | Real Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | `kb.search` | Cross-page full-text search; ReBAC filtering (returns only pages where the caller has viewer+ permission) | `{query, kbId?, folderId?, authorId?, format?, pageSize?, pageToken?, sync?}` | `GET /api/v1/search/pages` |

Underlying: **Meilisearch (fuzzy + typo tolerance + Chinese word segmentation) + NATS event-driven indexing**. Return structure:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "page": { "id": "pg-...", "title": "...", "path": "...", "format": "markdown" },
      "highlights": [
        { "field": "title", "snippet": "Week 21 <mark>Weekly Meeting Minutes</mark>" },
        { "field": "body",  "snippet": "..." }
      ],
      "score": 0.98
    }
  ],
  "pagination": { "next_page_token": null, "total_count": 1 }
}
```

**`sync=true` is for the Agent**: when the Agent searches right after writing a page, the async index may not be built yet. `sync=true` waits for the Meilisearch task to complete before returning (up to a 5s timeout), guaranteeing you read what was just written. Human users default to async for fast UX.

Rate limit: 1000 requests/minute/workspace.

### File Attachments (KB Upload Only)

| Status | Command | Description | Input | Real Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | `kb.upload` | Upload a file and register a file node in the KB tree (syntactic sugar for KB-mode upload) | `{kbId, filePath, parentId?, contentType?, filename?}` | Delegates to `as.uploadMedia()` → the three prepare/PUT/finalize steps, see `references/as-operations.md` |
| ✅ | `kb.file_create` | Register a file node in the KB tree using an existing artifact (the last internal step of `kb.upload`) | `{kbId, name, artifactId, parentId?}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/files` |
| ✅ | `kb.file_preview` | Get a file node's inline preview URL (embedded in the browser) | `{kbId, nodeId}` | `GET /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/nodes/{node_id}/preview` |
| ✅ | `kb.file_download` | Get a single file node's download URL (inline optional) | `{kbId, nodeId, inline?}` | `GET /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/nodes/{node_id}/download` |
| ✅ | `kb.file_batch_download` | Get pre-signed download URLs for multiple file nodes at once | `{kbId, nodeIds, inline?}` | `POST /api/v1/kbs/{kb_id}/tree/files/batch-download` |

`kb.upload` is syntactic sugar for `as.upload` without `conversationId` in KB mode, and **a file node will appear in the KB tree** (the response has `nodeId` + `treeNode`); afterwards you can operate on it with `kb.node_get` / `kb.file_preview` / `kb.file_download`.

**Do not use `kb.upload` to send conversation attachments**: images or files in a conversation / DM must go through **IM upload** (`as.upload` with `conversationId`; see "Which upload path to use" at the top of [as-operations.md](./as-operations.md)), otherwise the file is attached to the KB but the recipient cannot see it in their chat window.

The returned `mediaId` / `artifactId` can also be dropped into a Page body (e.g. writing `![](artifact://<id>)` in markdown), letting the page body directly reference this artifact.

## Typical Flows

### Agent writes a page of weekly meeting minutes then immediately searches to verify

```bash
# 1. Create the page
node src/cli/kb.js kb.page_create '{
  "kbId":"<kb-uuid>",
  "title":"2026-05-21 Weekly Meeting Minutes",
  "parentId":"<folder-node-id>",
  "format":"markdown",
  "body":"# 2026-05-21 Weekly Meeting Minutes\n\n## Agenda\n\n...",
  "message":"feat: Agent auto-generated weekly meeting minutes"
}'
# -> {id:"pg-...", current_revision_id:1, ...}

# 2. Immediately search to verify (sync=true waits for the index to be built)
node src/cli/kb.js kb.search '{"query":"weekly meeting minutes","sync":true,"limit":5}'
# -> {results:[{page:{id:"pg-..."}, highlights:[...], score:0.95}], ...}
```

### Lead context assembly — finding a project's design decision document

```bash
# 1. Search within a given folder
node src/cli/kb.js kb.search '{
  "query":"architecture decisions",
  "folderId":"tn-projects-growth",
  "format":"markdown",
  "limit":20
}'

# 2. After getting the page_id, read the detailed content
node src/cli/kb.js kb.page_content '{"pageId":"pg-arch-decisions-001"}'

# 3. Look at the change history (if the content seems off)
node src/cli/kb.js kb.page_revisions '{"pageId":"pg-arch-decisions-001"}'
node src/cli/kb.js kb.page_diff '{
  "pageId":"pg-arch-decisions-001",
  "fromRevisionId":3,
  "toRevisionId":5
}'
```

### Attaching an Agent's output under a KB node

```bash
# 1. Upload the output file via as.js (KB mode, without conversationId)
node src/cli/as.js as.upload '{
  "filePath":"/tmp/q2-report.pdf",
  "mediaType":"file"
}'
# -> {artifactId:"art_...", nodeId:"tn-...", treeNode:{...}, instantUpload:false}

# 2. Write a deliverables index page that references this artifact
node src/cli/kb.js kb.page_create '{
  "kbId":"<kb-uuid>",
  "parentId":"<deliverables-folder-id>",
  "title":"Q2 Deliverables Index",
  "body":"# Q2 Deliverables\n\n- [Report](artifact://art_...)"
}'
```

## Frontend Link Assembly (Agent-Error-Prone, Must Read)

A KB page has **two kinds of ID**, and mixing them up causes the link to open blank or 404:

| ID Type | Source | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **page_id** | the `id` returned by `kb.page_create` / `kb.page_get` | Page content operations (read/write, revision, trash) | `019ed02a-62cc-...` |
| **node_id** | the `node_id` returned by `kb.page_create`, or the `id` returned by `kb.node_get` / `kb.node_children` | Directory tree operations + **frontend URL** | `019ed02a-62d5-...` |

**Core rule: the frontend URL's `node=` parameter only accepts node_id. Putting a page_id in makes the link point to the wrong location.**

### Create response contract

`kb.page_create` creates both the page and its corresponding tree node. Its response returns the page as the top-level object and includes the created tree node as `node_id`:

```json
// kb.page_create response
{"id": "019ed02a-62cc-...", "node_id": "019ed02a-62d5-...", "kb_id": "...", "title": "...", "path": "...", ...}
//  id is the page_id; node_id is the tree node used by frontend links
```

`kb.page_get` still returns page metadata only. If a page did not come from the current `kb.page_create` response, obtain its node ID from the tree.

### The correct link-generation flow

To share a link immediately after creating a page, use the returned `node_id` directly:

```bash
# 1. Create the page → get both page_id and node_id
node src/cli/kb.js kb.page_create '{
  "kbId":"<kb-uuid>",
  "title":"Design Proposal",
  "parentId":"<folder-node-id>",
  "body":"# Proposal content..."
}'
# → {"id":"pg-abc123", "node_id":"tn-xyz789", ...}

# 2. Assemble the frontend link with the returned node_id
node src/cli/core.js core.frontend_url '{"path":"/knowledge?kb=<kb-uuid>&node=tn-xyz789"}'
# → https://xxx/cws/knowledge?kb=...&node=tn-xyz789    ✅ correct
```

**Counter-example (wrong)**:
```bash
# ❌ Using the page id (`id`) instead of `node_id`
node src/cli/core.js core.frontend_url '{"path":"/knowledge?kb=<kb-uuid>&node=pg-abc123"}'
# → the link opens but shows blank or points to the wrong location
```

### You have a page_id but don't know the node_id

If you have only the page_id (e.g. obtained from `kb.search` results), use `kb.page_get` to read the `path` field to locate the directory, then use `kb.node_children` to match by `page_id` under the corresponding folder.

### URL Format Quick Reference

For the full URL template, see [`SKILL.md` Frontend Links](../SKILL.md). Quick reference:

```
{bff_url}/cws/knowledge?kb={kb_id}&node={node_id}
                                         ↑ must be the tree node_id, not the page_id
```

You can generate it in one step with the `core.frontend_url` CLI, avoiding errors from hand-assembling the domain and prefix.

## KB-Specific Caveats

- **org_id is required**: every command needs a scope. If `config.org_id` is not set, it throws.
- `kb.list`: an org usually has only 1 KB (per `kb_org_configs`), but list returns an array to allow future expansion
- Page writes are rate-limited: 60 requests/minute/user (`rate_limited` 429)
- `kb.search` results are ReBAC-filtered: only pages where the caller has `viewer+` permission are returned
- `format` values: `markdown` / `code` / `pdf` / `image` / `archive` / `other`
- Tree node ordering: nodes under the same parent are ordered by `sort_order`; when moving a node you can specify a new `sortOrder`
- Cross-org references use the `kb://pg-{uuid}` URI (a stable ID, unchanged by move / rename)
- `kb.page_delete` called directly returns 404 — you must run `kb.page_trash` first; this is cws-kb's three-state protection chain (don't work around it)
- `kb.page_restore` vs `kb.page_restore_trash` have similar names but completely different semantics; see "The two restore operations are not the same thing" above
- **The frontend URL only accepts node_id**: after `kb.page_create`, use its `node_id` field, never its page `id`. If only a page_id is available from another operation, resolve the corresponding node from the tree. See the dedicated "Frontend Link Assembly" section above
