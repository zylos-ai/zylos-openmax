# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.14] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- **SKILL.md: complex-task guardrail now mandates one-shot instantiation of all
  Blueprint steps.** After a Blueprint is approved, the Lead MUST instantiate
  *all* steps as Tasks at once with their `dependsOn` dependencies set —
  piecemeal "create one step at a time as you go" is now explicitly forbidden.
  Dependency-driven flow: independent steps enter `running` (进行中) in parallel;
  dependent steps wait in `pending` (待办) and auto-advance to `running` once
  their predecessor is `done`. This makes the kanban/task panel show the full
  DAG of an issue from the start (what's running / waiting / blocked). Documents
  the board semantic: **待办 = planned-but-dependency-blocked steps**, not
  not-yet-decomposed steps. Added a matching row to the 常见错误 table.
- **Renamed the skill from `coco-agent` to `coco-workspace`** for naming
  consistency — frontmatter `name`, and the per-message injected directive tag
  `<coco-agent>` → `<coco-workspace>` (src/lib/message.js; directive body
  already referenced "coco-workspace skill"). No code parses the tag literally,
  so the rename is behavior-neutral.
- **Trimmed redundant skill text (conservative dedup; 3-layer reinforcement
  structure kept):** removed the redundant "强制加载提示" note (enforcement lives
  in code, not in a skill declaration); consolidated the duplicated
  one-shot-instantiation wording between 复杂任务流程 step 6 and guardrail #9
  (step 6 is now the authority, #9 a terse red-line pointer); merged two
  near-identical Blueprint anti-pattern rows in the 常见错误 table into one.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Dedup retention is now count-based instead of time-based (TTL).** The
  message_id deduper previously evicted ids after a 5-minute TTL. A
  reconnect/restart catch-up can replay up to `SYNC_MAX_EVENTS` (2000) events
  regardless of how long the bot was offline, so after an outage longer than the
  TTL the replayed ids had already aged out — letting duplicates leak back into
  delivery. `createDeduper` now retains the most recent `maxEntries` ids
  (default 5000, well above the catch-up cap) and drops the TTL sweep entirely;
  `ttlMs` is kept only for call-site backward-compat. `comm-bridge.js` wires the
  persistent deduper with `maxEntries: 20` — enough for a normal restart, where
  catch-up only re-pulls a handful. Caveat: an outage long enough that a single
  catch-up re-pulls >20 messages could replay the tail beyond the most-recent
  20; bump `maxEntries` to cover longer outages if needed.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **HOTFIX: revert the global seq-floor delivery gate from 1.0.10 — it dropped
  live messages and caused a delivery outage.** The 1.0.10 gate assumed `seq`
  was a per-org monotonic cursor and dropped any inbound with
  `seq <= sessionRef.last_seq`. In reality `seq` is **per-conversation**: after a
  reconnect catch-up advanced the single org-wide `last_seq` to a high value
  (from one busy conversation), brand-new messages in other conversations (with
  lower per-conversation seq) were misclassified as "already delivered" and
  silently dropped — no messages got through. Removed the seq gate entirely.
  Duplicate suppression now relies solely on the **id-based deduper**, which the
  1.0.10 change also made **persistent** (`runtime/dedup.json`) — that part is
  safe and is kept, so restart/reconnect still gets reduced (id-based) replay
  protection without the over-dropping bug. `last_seq` remains the catch-up
  cursor only. Lesson: never gate delivery on a per-conversation seq with an
  org-wide cursor.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- **post-install now gates env-vs-interactive on `COCO_API_KEY`.** Previously the
  hook chose its path purely by TTY (interactive on a terminal, env-driven
  without one). Now: if `COCO_API_KEY` has a value, the hook takes **everything**
  from env vars (borrowing the same env keys as `scripts/init-coco-workspace.sh`:
  `COCO_BFF_URL` / `COCO_WS_URL` / `COCO_IDENTITY_ID` / `COCO_MEMBER_ID` /
  `COCO_ORG_ID` / `COCO_ORG_NAME` / `COCO_OWNER_*` / `COCO_SELF_NAME` /
  `COCO_CF_ACCESS_*`) and writes config with **no prompts — even on a TTY**.
  When `COCO_API_KEY` is absent, behavior is **unchanged**: interactive prompts
  on a TTY, otherwise the non-interactive env + auto-register bootstrap. Minimal
  change — only the path-selection gate (`useEnvPath = hasEnvApiKey || !isInteractive`)
  was added; the interactive and env blocks themselves are untouched, so the
  existing idempotency (existing `agent.api_key` is never overwritten) and the
  auto-register fallback are preserved.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Duplicate message delivery after a service restart / WS reconnect.** The
  inbound deduper was in-memory only (`createDeduper`, a TTL Map), so a process
  restart wiped it; the persisted `last_seq` cursor was only *advanced* after
  forwarding and never used to *gate* delivery. On restart/reconnect the
  catch-up re-sync re-pulled recent messages and, with the deduper empty, they
  were re-delivered as new (observed as a burst of already-handled messages).
  Two fixes:
  - **Persistent seq floor (primary)** — `comm-bridge.js` now drops any inbound
    whose `seq <= sessionRef.last_seq` right after seq is hoisted (covers both
    live frames and sync catch-up). Since `last_seq` is persisted to
    `runtime/session.json` and reloaded on warm restart, an already-processed
    message can't be re-delivered even after the in-memory deduper resets.
    `last_seq` is still advanced only after a message is forwarded, preserving
    exactly-once delivery.
  - **Persistent deduper (belt-and-suspenders)** — `createDeduper` gained an
    optional `persistPath`; the seen-id window is backed by `runtime/dedup.json`
    (debounced atomic writes, TTL-pruned on load) so it survives a restart and
    covers the narrow crash-window case where a message was forwarded but
    `last_seq` wasn't yet saved. Best-effort: fs errors degrade to in-memory.
  - Scope: `src/comm-bridge.js` + `src/lib/ws.js` (+ `RUNTIME_DIR` export from
    `src/lib/session.js`). No protocol or cross-component changes.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Forced skill-flow directive injected into every inbound envelope
  (`message.enforceSkillFlow`, default true) — enforcement L1, belt-and-suspenders
  on top of the v1.0.7 imperative description.** A `SKILL.md` is load-on-demand
  guidance, not a runtime gate: an agent only follows the task flow if it
  actually loads + obeys the coco-agent skill on that message. The skill
  description (v1.0.7) already nudges this, but per Gavin's directive we now also
  inject the rule into the message itself. `formatInboundForC4` leads every coco
  inbound message with a short `<coco-agent>` directive block (mirrors the
  existing `<smart-mode>` injection) telling the agent to **load the coco-agent
  skill and run its task flow before handling** — judge task vs. chat; if a task,
  confirm project + KB, register Issue→Task (whoever executes creates it), follow
  the simple/complex flow, and wait for the initiator's acceptance before
  set_acceptance/archive; bidirectional DM-permission check before cross-agent
  dispatch. The block is deliberately terse (a pointer, not the full skill) to
  keep per-message token cost minimal. The rule **travels with the component**:
  upgrading coco-workspace on any bot auto-applies it, no per-bot instruction
  edits. Toggle off via `config.message.enforceSkillFlow = false`. Note: still
  strong guidance, not a hard gate — a true 100% gate needs server-side
  enforcement at task intake (cws-core). Revives the approach from PR #18
  (previously closed in favor of the description-only route).

## [1.0.8] - 2026-06-10

### Docs
- **Complex tasks now hard-require a Blueprint + approval (was descriptive, now a guardrail).**
  The complex-task flow already *described* generating a Blueprint and getting
  it approved, but nothing forbade running a genuinely complex job in `light`
  mode — decomposing it straight into a pile of Tasks and starting work,
  skipping the blueprint and its approval gate. That shortcut hollows out the
  complex-task flow (no plan, no approval). SKILL.md now states the constraint
  explicitly in three places:
  - **判断简单/复杂** section: a new callout — *复杂任务 = heavy 模式 + Blueprint（强制，不可绕过）*；
    `light` mode is only for single-output/single-agent simple tasks; anything
    multi-step / multi-agent / dependency-bearing must go heavy + Blueprint;
    when unsure, ask.
  - **复杂任务流程** steps 3–4: generating the Blueprint and passing approval are
    marked mandatory gates — no Task may be instantiated before the Blueprint is
    approved.
  - **行为护栏** new rule 8 + two 常见错误 rows: a complex task run via `light` to
    bypass the blueprint, and instantiating Tasks with no approved Blueprint,
    are both named as errors. Per Gavin's directive.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **Skill `description` rewritten into an imperative load-and-follow directive.**
  The old description ("…首次行为决策时加载") was too soft — agents (even ones on
  the latest skill) judged a request answerable directly and never loaded the
  full SKILL.md, so the task flow never triggered. The description is the exact
  signal the model uses to decide whether to load a skill, and it's **always in
  context** (auto-discovered, prompt-cached) and **travels with the component**
  (no per-bot CLAUDE.md edits). It now says: any message received via
  coco-workspace → before handling a task, **must load and obey this skill** →
  judge task vs. chat; if a task, run the full flow (confirm project + KB →
  register Issue→Task [whoever executes creates it] → execute → initiator
  acceptance before completion/archive). Cost: the full skill loads at most once
  per session, then is cached. Chosen over per-message envelope injection
  (cheaper, portable). Honest limit: still strong guidance, not a hard runtime
  gate — a 100% gate needs server-side enforcement at task intake (cws-core).

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-09

### Docs
- **Cross-agent delegation: DM-permission + whoever-executes-creates-the-task; acceptance gates completion.** Three fixes after a real delegation failure (a Worker finished but its bot-DM completion report never reached the Lead):
  - **DM permission at dispatch (root cause)**: a Worker's report DM is dropped when the Lead's `dmPolicy` is `owner`/`allowlist` and the Worker isn't allowlisted — so the Lead never learns the task finished. SKILL now mandates: before delegating, add the Worker's `member_id` to the Lead's `dmAllowFrom` (set `dmPolicy=allowlist` if needed) **and** confirm the Worker's policy allows the Lead. Corrected the stale "Worker reply surfaces via WS" claim in the cross-agent section.
  - **Whoever executes creates the Task**: the Lead creates only the **Issue** + conveys the goal; the **assigned bot creates its own Task** under that Issue and claims it (Lead no longer pre-`task.create({assigneeId})`). Reconciled the role-model note (carved out the "register your own delegated work" exception) and reordered the simple-flow steps (confirm executor → create Issue → executor creates Task → execute).
  - **Human acceptance gates BOTH completion and archive**: a Worker's `attempt/task → done` only means "execution finished"; the Issue reaching **accepted (「完成」)** and **archived** both require the initiating human's 验收 — the bot never self-advances to accepted/archived.
  - New guardrail rule 7 + three common-errors rows.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-06-09

### Docs
- **Human-acceptance loop + project/KB-first ordering encoded in `SKILL.md`.**
  Two follow-ups requested after v1.0.4:
  - **Acceptance loop (issue 789741f8)**: the API already supports it
    (`issue.set_acceptance {accepted, source:im|explicit, rejectionReason}` →
    accepted→archived / rejected→rework), but the behavior wasn't encoded. SKILL
    now mandates: after delivery the bot **must request acceptance from the human
    who INITIATED the task** (the task initiator, identified via the issue's
    `originConversationId` — NOT the bot itself, NOT the owner, NOT an arbitrary
    user; a Worker relays via its Lead) **and must NOT self-accept/self-archive**;
    on 验收通过 → `set_acceptance(accepted:true)` → archived; on 退回 →
    `set_acceptance(accepted:false, rejectionReason)` → reopened → executing.
    Added as guardrail rule 6 + rewrote the "验收 & 状态收敛" step in both
    simple/complex flows + three common-errors rows. "任务做完≠结束，发起人验收通过才
    归档." Stale `pending_acceptance` wording corrected to the real
    delivered→accepted→archived states.
  - **Project/KB-first ordering (issue cbc24d82) — BOTH simple AND complex
    tasks**: simple-task flow gets an explicit step 4 「登记 Issue→Task」 and the
    complex-task flow's step 2 now requires confirming **project + KB** with the
    user before orchestration/execution — both enforcing *confirm project/KB →
    register Issue→Task → execute* (no execute-then-backfill).
  - **Executor-bot selection must be user-confirmed**: the bot must NOT
    auto-assign the executing agent. It **recommends** based on agent
    descriptions (with rationale) but the **task initiator confirms/chooses**
    which bot runs it (COCO-self only as a confirmed fallback). Updated the
    trigger note, simple-flow step 5, complex-flow step 5 (assignee chosen at
    blueprint-approval/instantiation), guardrail rule 2, +1 common-errors row.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Image/file messages now carry a `[image]` / `[file: name]` label in the
  message body** instead of an empty `said:`. The bridge built the C4 envelope
  with the raw text as the body (empty when an image has no caption) and only
  appended the media as a `---- <kind>: <path>` suffix, so a bare image arrived
  as `said:` with nothing after it. `comm-bridge.js` now sets the body to
  `[image]` / `[file: <name>]` (with any caption appended), keeping the
  `---- <kind>: <path>` suffix for the local path (`src/comm-bridge.js`).
- **Quoted image/file messages now reach the agent — with content, not just a
  label.** A reply that quotes an image/file with no caption produced empty
  quoted text, so the whole `<replying-to>` was dropped (the agent couldn't even
  tell an image was quoted). `comm-bridge.js` now (1) labels the quoted media as
  `[image]` / `[file: <name>]`, and (2) downloads the quoted message's
  attachment and appends `---- <kind>: <path>` to the quoted text, so the agent
  can actually read the referenced media — not merely know it exists
  (`src/comm-bridge.js`).

### Docs
- **Mandatory task-lifecycle guardrails added to `SKILL.md`** (new
  「任务生命周期护栏（强制）」section under 行为护栏). Encodes the behaviors that
  were defined-but-not-followed: (1) **every** handling must first create a Task
  in TM (Issue→Task) before executing — no "small enough to skip" exception, (2)
  require user project/KB selection for deliverable tasks
  (default Inbox only for internal bug-filing), (3) notify the user at the
  moment of every issue/task status transition, (4) notify on every task
  completion, (5) auto-continue to the next task by priority after finishing
  one. Closes the agent-conformance issues (e9291b91, 15cd9249).
- **Hardened the project/KB-selection + Issue→Task trigger rules** after a
  smoke test showed a simple research task (gold-price analysis / connector
  list) skipping project/KB selection. Changes: the 触发 section now lists two
  non-skippable up-front actions for any 任务 — register Issue→Task, and confirm
  project + KB — explicitly **not exempt for "simple" tasks**; simple-task flow
  steps 2/3 make project/KB a mandatory question (禁止默默用默认); guardrail rule 1
  names skipping Issue→Task registration as the #1 root cause of "task flow not
  triggered"; guardrail rule 2 states simple research/analysis reports are NOT
  exempt. Closes cbc24d82.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **`COCO_RPC_LOG_FILE` env var** — append every RPC request/response line to a
  file, independent of the stdout sink (`COCO_RPC_LOG`). Use case: in
  integration phase we run smoke tests with `COCO_RPC_LOG=0` to keep the test
  client output readable, but still want full RPC traces on disk for
  post-mortem. Set `COCO_RPC_LOG_FILE=<path>` to enable file logging; unset or
  empty disables it. Format: `<ISO-timestamp> [rpc] → <method> <url> req: ...`
  / `[rpc] ← <method> <url> resp <status>: ...`. Wired in both
  `src/lib/client.js` (REST traffic) and `src/lib/token.js` (auth handshake).
  Best-effort: disk errors are swallowed silently so RPCs never fail because
  the log file is unwritable.
- **Outbound @-mention canonicalization** (`src/lib/mention.js`). cws-fe
  highlights a mention by matching `@<participant display_name>` in the message
  text (no member_id/token in the body — purely client-side name matching). The
  bridge now records the display names it sees per conversation
  (`recordParticipants`, from inbound sender + group context), and `send.js`
  runs `resolveMentions` to canonicalize any `@name` token in outbound text to
  the exact recorded display_name (case/spacing-tolerant, longest-name-first),
  so the agent's mentions land on cws-fe's matcher. Render-side highlighting for
  agent (`AGENT_TEXT`) messages is tracked in cws-fe issue #6; once that lands,
  these canonicalized mentions light up with no further change here.

### Fixed
- **Quoted/reply messages now reach the agent.** When an inbound message is a
  reply (cws-comm `parent_id`), the bridge fetches the quoted message and
  surfaces it as a `<replying-to>` block. Previously `comm-bridge.js` never
  built `quotedContent`, so replies were invisible to the agent even though
  `formatInboundForC4` already supported the block (`src/comm-bridge.js`).
- **`<group-context>` is now chronological (oldest→newest).** cws-comm
  `list-messages` with `before_seq` returns DESC (newest→oldest); the bridge
  passed that order straight through, so group history read backwards. It now
  sorts the fetched context ascending by `seq` before formatting
  (`src/comm-bridge.js`).

### Docs
- **Access-control section added to `SKILL.md`** documenting per-org
  `dmPolicy` (`open`/`allowlist`/`owner`), `groupPolicy`
  (`open`/`allowlist`/`disabled`), per-group `mode`/`allowFrom`, and
  `dmAllowFrom` — all keyed by cws-core `member_id`, with a config example and
  the DM/group independence note (closes #10).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **Invitation CLI aligned with the create-time display-name contract**
  (cws-core #86). The invitee display name is now set when the invitation is
  created (stored on the invitation, becomes `members.display_name` on accept)
  rather than supplied at accept time:
  - `core.invitation_create` now sends a **required** `display_name`
    (accepts `displayName` or `display_name`; server rejects blank with 400).
  - `core.invitation_accept` no longer sends `display_name` — the body is now
    just `{token}` (sending `display_name` would be schema-invalid post-#86).
  - Usage text and `references/core-operations.md` (command rows + flow
    examples) updated to match.
- **Improved the COCO inbound message envelope** delivered to the agent, for
  parity with other C4 channels:
  - Resolve the sender's display name (and group-context senders) via a cached
    `GET /api/v1/members/{id}`, falling back to the raw member id only when no
    name is available.
  - Minimal `reply via` target: `<conversationId>[|reply:..][|thread:..]
    [|parent:..]` — the `[COCO TYPE]/` prefix (never used for routing) is
    dropped. `parseEndpoint` still accepts the legacy `[COCO TYPE]/...` form,
    so in-flight messages remain replyable.
  - The attributed utterance (`<name> said: <content>`) now lives inside the
    `<current-message>` block, with the conversation-type tag on its own line.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Outbound `scripts/send.js` was POSTing the old `MessageContent[]` array
  body, which cws-core now rejects with HTTP 422.** cws-core's current
  `sendMessageRequest` (see `internal/transport/http/message.go`) takes a
  single `content` object plus a top-level `type` enum:

  ```
  { client_msg_id, type, content: {content_type, body, attachments}, parent_id? }
  ```

  v0.3.8 and earlier sent:

  ```
  { client_msg_id, content: [{type, body}], reply_to? }
  ```

  Rewrote `sendText` and `sendMediaMessage` to the new schema:
  - text and markdown → `type: 'AGENT_TEXT'`,
    `content: { content_type: 'text'|'markdown', body: { text }, attachments: [] }`
  - image and file → `type: 'IMAGE'|'FILE'`, `content.attachments` array
    with `{artifact_id, file_name, content_type, size_bytes}` (mediaId
    from cws-as upload IS the artifact_id; mediaId stays as the
    short-name in the bridge but maps onto attachments)
  - reply target field renamed `reply_to` → `parent_id` to match
    cws-core's `ParentID *string` field

- **Inbound message content arrived empty in the C4 envelope** because
  the bridge read `msg.content.text`, but after spreading the
  get-message detail into `msg`, `msg.content` is the structured
  `{content_type, body, attachments}` object — the actual text is at
  `msg.content.body.text` (or, as a string shortcut, at
  `msg.message.content`). `formatInboundForC4` therefore got an empty
  string and Claude saw `said: ` with no body. Bridge now extracts text
  via:

  ```
  msg.content?.body?.text
    || (typeof msg.message?.content === 'string' ? msg.message.content : '')
    || (typeof msg.content === 'string' ? msg.content : '')
    || ''
  ```

  and pulls the media reference from `msg.content.attachments[0]`
  (`artifact_id` / `file_name`) instead of the legacy `media_id` /
  `filename` flat fields. Legacy fallbacks are kept so older payload
  shapes still parse.

- **`fetchRecentMessages` context lines** had the same blind spot; they
  now also read `m.content.body.text` before falling back to
  `typeof m.content === 'string' ? m.content : ''`.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **`forwardToC4` was calling `c4-receive.js` with positional args
  (`<channel> <endpoint> <body>`), which `c4-receive.js` now rejects with
  `Error: Unexpected argument: coco-workspace`.** The comm-bridge interface
  switched to named flags (`--channel` / `--endpoint` / `--content` /
  `--json`) and zylos-telegram / zylos-lark already use the new form;
  zylos-coco-workspace never followed. The breakage was masked until
  v0.3.7 because the case-sensitivity bug in `shouldHandleMessage` was
  dropping every inbound DM before it ever reached the C4 forward step.
  - Switched `forwardToC4` to the named-flag form
    (`--channel <slug> --endpoint <endpoint> --json --content <body>`).
  - `execFile` passes argv array directly, so `body` is forwarded
    verbatim with no shell escaping required.
  - `--json` matches what telegram/lark already do, paving the way for
    parsing structured rejection responses in a future change.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **DMs were misrouted into the group/thread branch of `shouldHandleMessage`
  because of a case mismatch.** cws-core's HTTP API returns conversation
  type as an uppercase enum (`DM` / `GROUP` / `STRAT` / `BROADCAST` /
  `BRIDGE`, per `internal/transport/http/cwscomm_models.go`), but
  `src/comm-bridge.js` and `src/lib/message.js` compared against the
  lowercase wire values `'dm'` / `'group'` / `'thread'`. As a result a real
  DM with `conv.type === "DM"` fell through to the group branch and was
  dropped by `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` with an empty `groups{}`, surfacing
  as `drop ...: group:allowlist (<conv> not in groups{})` in the bridge
  log even when the inbound message was a 1-on-1 DM with the owner.
  - `shouldHandleMessage` and the late `convType` recompute in
    `handleIncomingMessage` now both normalize `conv?.type` to lowercase
    before classification.
  - `formatInboundForC4` likewise lowercases before checking
    `VALID_TYPES`, so the C4 envelope tag (`[COCO DM]` / `[COCO GROUP]` /
    `[COCO THREAD]`) reflects the actual conversation type.

### Added
- **Log every inbound WS message frame** at the entry of
  `handleIncomingMessage`, before dedupe / fetch. Previously only the
  REST `GET /messages/{id}` follow-up call left a trace, which made it
  hard to see whether a WS push had actually arrived. New format:
  ```
  [ws] [<org-slug>] message frame: id=<id> conv=<conv_id> sender=<sender_id>
  ```
  Duplicate-suppressed frames now also log
  `[ws] [<org-slug>] msg=<id> duplicate, skipping` instead of silently
  returning, so a noisy retry loop is visible in the log instead of
  appearing as a missing push.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **`ws_url` was sticky across re-installs.** Both `hooks/configure.js`
  and `hooks/post-install.js` only auto-derived `ws_url` from the
  (possibly new) `bff_url` when the existing `config.server.ws_url` was
  empty. A previous install's `DEFAULT_CONFIG` seed
  (`ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws`) therefore survived after the operator
  pointed `bff_url` at a real cws-core, and the runtime kept trying to
  connect to localhost.
  - `configure.js` now re-derives `ws_url` from `bff_url` unconditionally
    when the operator did not supply `COCO_WS_URL`. Explicit
    `COCO_WS_URL` is still honored verbatim for the case where cws-comm
    is on a different host.
  - `post-install.js` Step 1 default now comes from the freshly entered
    `bff_url`, not from the stale `config.server.ws_url`. Operators can
    still override at the prompt.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Frame watchdog killed healthy WebSocket connections at ~90s.**
  `src/lib/ws.js` only refreshed `lastFrameAt` inside the `'message'`
  event handler, which fires for data frames only. cws-comm sends
  WebSocket protocol-level **Ping** control frames every 30s
  (`internal/transport/ws/conn.go` `RunPingLoop`), and the npm `ws`
  library auto-replies with Pong frames — but those control frames fire
  the `'ping'` / `'pong'` events, NOT `'message'`. So even on a perfectly
  healthy connection the watchdog saw "no frames received within the
  65 s window" at its third 30 s tick and called `ws.terminate()`,
  producing a misleading abnormal-close cycle (code 1006).
  - Subscribed `ws.on('ping')` and `ws.on('pong')` to also refresh
    `lastFrameAt`.
  - Added a single-line `[ws] ping received` debug trace so server-side
    Ping cadence is visible in `pm2 logs` (cheap — cws-comm default
    `PingInterval` is 30 s).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-02

### Breaking
- **`COCO_ORG_IDS` (plural, comma-separated) replaced by `COCO_ORG_ID`
  (singular).** The non-interactive install path now binds exactly one
  (agent, org) pair per prepare run, matching cws-agent-manager-sdk-go's
  `AgentInitialization.CoCoWorkspaceChannelAuth` proto field shape 1:1.
  Operators that need a single runtime to serve multiple orgs run the
  prepare hook once per org_id; the hook is idempotent (existing
  `config.agent.api_key` and existing `org_id` blocks short-circuit), so
  re-running is safe. The interactive (`zylos add`) flow keeps its
  multi-org loop unchanged.

### Added
- **Channel-auth-aligned org metadata env vars** in the non-interactive
  install path. An operator with a `CoCoWorkspaceChannelAuth` payload can
  map every field to env vars 1:1:
  - `COCO_ORG_NAME`        → proto `org_name`        → `orgs.<slug>.org_name`
  - `COCO_OWNER_MEMBER_ID` → proto `owner.member_id` → `orgs.<slug>.owner.member_id`
  - `COCO_OWNER_NAME`      → proto `owner.name`      → `orgs.<slug>.owner.name`
  - `COCO_SELF_NAME`       → proto `self.name`       → `orgs.<slug>.self.name`
  All four are optional; absent fields fall through to existing runtime
  defaults (`owner` auto-binds on first DM under `dmPolicy=owner`,
  `self.member_id` auto-fills from JWT claims on first WS connect,
  display names start empty).
- `seedOrg(orgId, opts)` refactor: takes an options object instead of a
  positional `memberId` arg so the five org-shape fields stay named.

### Mapping reference
`proto AgentInitialization.CoCoWorkspaceChannelAuth → env var`:

| proto                       | env var                |
|---|---|
| `server.bff_url`            | `COCO_BFF_URL`         |
| `server.ws_url`             | `COCO_WS_URL`          |
| `api_key`                   | `COCO_API_KEY`         |
| `org_id`                    | `COCO_ORG_ID`          |
| `org_name`                  | `COCO_ORG_NAME`        |
| `owner.member_id`           | `COCO_OWNER_MEMBER_ID` |
| `owner.name`                | `COCO_OWNER_NAME`      |
| `self.member_id`            | `COCO_MEMBER_ID`       |
| `self.name`                 | `COCO_SELF_NAME`       |

`identity_id` is **not** in the proto; the hook continues to require
`COCO_IDENTITY_ID` for the BYO path until the proto contract decides
whether to add it.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **BYO agent prompt never fires under `zylos add`.** The configure hook
  (`hooks/configure.js`) used to delegate to `hooks/post-install.js` via
  dynamic import. Because configure runs *before* the TTY-interactive
  post-install pass, post-install detected `process.stdin.isTTY === false`
  in that nested call and went down the env-driven non-interactive branch
  — which auto-registered the agent. By the time the real (TTY-interactive)
  post-install ran, `config.agent.api_key` was already set, so the idempotency
  guard short-circuited Step 2 and the v0.3.2 BYO prompt was never asked.
- The fix narrows `configure.js` to a single responsibility: read the stdin
  JSON, persist `COCO_BFF_URL` / `COCO_WS_URL` into `config.server.*`, exit.
  It no longer registers the agent, seeds orgs, or imports post-install.
  `zylos add`'s subsequent post-install invocation then runs in TTY mode
  with `config.server.*` pre-filled as defaults and prompts BYO + org_ids
  as designed in v0.3.2.

### Migration
- If you upgraded to v0.3.2 and the auto-register fired against your will,
  your `~/zylos/components/coco-workspace/config.json` already holds the
  unintended `agent.identity_id` + `api_key`. Two ways to recover:
  1. Delete config.json and re-run `zylos add coco-workspace`. The BYO
     prompt will fire correctly under v0.3.3+.
  2. Manually replace `config.agent.{identity_id, api_key}` with the values
     from your pre-provisioned agent, then set
     `orgs.<slug>.self.member_id` to the corresponding member_id.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Bring-your-own (BYO) agent identity at install.** Step 2 of the install
  flow now asks three fields up front — `identity_id`, `api_key`,
  `member_id`. If all three are non-empty the install uses them verbatim
  and skips `POST /auth/register/agent` entirely. Any blank field falls
  back to the existing auto-register flow.
  - **Why:** when an agent was pre-provisioned elsewhere (e.g. via
    `POST /api/v1/platform-agents` from an admin UI), the operator already
    has these three IDs. Forcing a re-register would burn a second identity.
  - The provided `member_id` is applied to the **first** org_id entered in
    the loop (`orgs[first].self.member_id`), since a BYO member_id is by
    definition tied to one specific org. Subsequent orgs auto-fill their
    member_id from JWT claims at runtime as before.
  - Non-interactive (env-driven) path picks up `COCO_IDENTITY_ID`,
    `COCO_API_KEY`, `COCO_MEMBER_ID` with the same all-three-or-none gate.
  - Idempotency preserved: an existing `config.agent.api_key` still
    short-circuits the whole step.

### Changed
- `SKILL.md` `config.optional` adds the three BYO env vars (api_key marked
  `sensitive: true`).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Verbose RPC logging.** `client.js` and `token.js` now print every
  outbound REST call as `[rpc] → METHOD url req: {...}` /
  `[rpc] ← METHOD url resp <status>: {...}`. Enabled by default in the test
  env; set `COCO_RPC_LOG=0` to silence (intended for production once Cloudflare
  Access plumbing is removed). 4xx/5xx responses log at `warn` level.

### Changed
- **Install seed: full default `orgs.<slug>` block.** Confirms the contract
  promised in v0.3.0 docs — when interactive install accepts an org_id, the
  written block now matches the layout operators are expected to edit
  manually:
  ```json
  {
    "enabled": true,
    "org_id":   "",
    "org_name": "",
    "owner": { "member_id": "", "name": "" },
    "self":  { "member_id": "", "name": "" },
    "access": {
      "dmPolicy":    "owner",
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "groups":      {}
    }
  }
  ```
  `dmAllowFrom` is no longer pre-seeded (runtime falls back to `[]` via the
  `access.dmAllowFrom || []` guard in `shouldHandleMessage`); `self.name`
  starts empty instead of `"Zylos"` so it doesn't leak a placeholder if the
  operator never edits it.
- `token.js` member_id write-back now seeds `self` as
  `{ member_id: '', name: '' }` (was `{ name: 'Zylos' }`) when the field
  is missing, matching the new install shape.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-02

### Breaking
- **register-agent contract aligned with current cws-core.** Previously the
  install hook sent `{ username, display_name }` to
  `POST /auth/register/agent`; cws-core now rejects those fields (HTTP 422)
  and the body must be empty `{}`. Old install transcripts have been failing
  since the cws-core auth refactor; this MR fixes the call.
- **Install prompt surface trimmed to the bare minimum.** Interactive install
  now asks only for `bff_url`, `ws_url`, then one or more `org_id`s in a
  loop. `username`, `display_name`, `member_id`, and per-org access policy
  are no longer asked at install time. `member_id` is auto-filled from JWT
  claims on first `/auth/agent/token` exchange; access policy defaults to
  `dmPolicy=owner` + `groupPolicy=allowlist` and can be edited in
  config.json afterwards.
- **`config.required` schema for `zylos add`** trimmed from five fields to
  one required (`COCO_BFF_URL`) plus two optional (`COCO_WS_URL`,
  `COCO_ORG_IDS` comma-separated). The legacy env vars
  (`COCO_AGENT_TICKET`, `COCO_AGENT_NAME`, `COCO_ORG_ID`,
  `COCO_SELF_MEMBER_ID`) are no longer read.

### Added
- **Multi-org JWT routing across the entire REST surface.** Previously
  `client.js` resolved the bearer token via `getAccessToken()` with no
  `orgId`, so multi-org agents fell back to the single-enabled-org or
  `COCO_ORG_ID` env var heuristic and could end up calling cws-core with the
  wrong org's JWT. New `getForOrg / postForOrg / patchForOrg / putForOrg /
  delForOrg` variants thread `orgId` straight through `doRequest` into
  `getAccessToken(orgId)`. `kbClient(orgId)` and `asClient(orgId)` also pass
  the org down, so every call from the per-org WS handlers, the CLIs, and
  the comm-bridge sync sweep uses that org's cached JWT.
- **JWT claim auto-fill for `self.member_id`.** When `token.exchange` returns
  an org-scoped JWT, the `member_id` claim is decoded and written back into
  `config.orgs[slug].self.member_id` if that field was empty. This lets
  interactive install stay one-shot and lets first-time agents respond to
  `@mentions` from the very first message after their JWT is minted.
- **Inflight Promise dedup** in `token.js` (per cache key: exchange / refresh
  / per-org). Concurrent boot of N orgs no longer fans out N parallel
  `/auth/agent/token` calls; the second-through-Nth caller awaits the
  first's Promise.
- **Identity-only JWT support** (`/auth/agent/token` body `{}`) — needed
  before an agent is in any org, e.g. to call `POST /api/v1/organizations`.
  `exchange('')` and `getAccessToken('')` mint and cache an identity-only
  JWT at `runtime/tokens/_identity.json`.
- **Bootstrap pre-mint.** `comm-bridge.js` now eagerly calls
  `getAccessToken(org_id)` for every enabled org before the first WS
  handshake, so `self.member_id` write-back lands before any inbound message
  hits the self-echo / @-mention filter. Failures are non-fatal — the WS
  urlProvider retries through the usual backoff loop.
- **Structured bootstrap logs** with `[install] / [bootstrap] / [token] /
  [ticket] / [ws]` prefixes; visible via `pm2 logs zylos-coco-workspace`.

### Changed
- Registration failure during install is now a **hard failure** (exit 1,
  config.json not written). Old behavior was to print a warning and let the
  operator retry by editing config.json — that left half-bootstrapped
  configs on disk.
- `token.invalidate()` distinguishes "clear all" (no arg) from "clear this
  org" (explicit org id, `''` for identity-only).

### Temporary — remove before production
- **`src/lib/cf-access.js`** hard-codes the `CF-Access-Client-Id` /
  `CF-Access-Client-Secret` service-token pair for `cws-int.coco.xyz`. Every
  outbound REST call (`client.js`, `token.js`, install hook fetch) and the
  WebSocket handshake (`ws.js`) spread `cfAccessHeaders()`. Production
  release MUST delete `cf-access.js` and the four import/spread sites it's
  referenced from.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter now declares the full lifecycle (modeled after
  `zylos-lark`), so `zylos add coco-workspace` drives the install
  end-to-end instead of stopping after download + register:
  - `type: communication`
  - `lifecycle.npm: true` → triggers `npm install --omit=dev`
  - `lifecycle.service.{type, name, entry}` → registers
    `pm2 zylos-coco-workspace` pointing at `src/comm-bridge.js`
  - `lifecycle.hooks.{post-install, post-upgrade, configure}` → wires
    the three hooks already in `hooks/`
  - `lifecycle.preserve: [config.json, logs/, runtime/]` → upgrade-safe
    fields
  - `lifecycle.data_dir` → declares the data root path explicitly
  - `upgrade.{repo, branch}` → `gitlab:coco-workspace/zylos-coco-workspace`
    on `main` (works with the existing zylos-core local patch that maps
    `gitlab:` repos to git.coco.xyz tarballs)
  - `config.required` → five fields (`COCO_BFF_URL`, `COCO_AGENT_TICKET`
    sensitive, `COCO_AGENT_NAME`, `COCO_ORG_ID`, `COCO_SELF_MEMBER_ID`)
    that `zylos add` will prompt the operator for.

- New `hooks/configure.js` — receives the prompted values as stdin JSON
  from `zylos add`, copies them into `process.env`, then delegates to
  `hooks/post-install.js`. This avoids reintroducing a `.env` round-trip
  (the canonical store remains `config.json`) while still letting the
  install flow drive the env-driven non-interactive bootstrap path that
  was added in v0.2.0.

### Behaviour after this version

```
zylos add coco-workspace --branch main
  → download from gitlab
  → npm install --omit=dev
  → prompt operator for 5 config fields
  → run hooks/configure.js (writes config.json via post-install)
  → run hooks/post-install.js again (idempotent no-op — api_key already
    set so registration is skipped)
  → start pm2 zylos-coco-workspace
```

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-02

### Removed
- `agent.client_id` — generated by post-install as UUIDv4 but never read by
  the runtime. Dropped from `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, dropped from post-install
  generation, and stripped from existing configs (top-level and
  `agent.client_id`) by `hooks/post-upgrade.js`. Cleanup-only — no
  functional impact since the field was dead.
- `server.platform` — same story (never read by runtime). Dropped from
  `DEFAULT_CONFIG`. `hooks/post-upgrade.js` strips it from both
  `comm.platform` (legacy v0.3 location) and `server.platform`
  (intermediate v0.4 migrations).

### Changed
- `server.reconnect_max_delay` and `server.heartbeat_interval` are no
  longer in `DEFAULT_CONFIG`. Defaults are now hardcoded as constants in
  `src/comm-bridge.js`:
  - `DEFAULT_WS_RECONNECT_MAX_MS = 30_000`
  - `DEFAULT_WS_HEARTBEAT_MS     = 30_000`

  Behavior: `config.server.{reconnect_max_delay, heartbeat_interval}` are
  still honoured if set, but the `server` block can now drop down to just
  `{bff_url, ws_url}`. Existing configs that include the knobs continue
  to work — values present in config still take precedence over the
  hardcoded defaults.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- `message.context_messages` and `message.dedup_ttl` are no longer part of
  `DEFAULT_CONFIG`. Defaults are now hardcoded as constants in
  `src/comm-bridge.js`:
  - `DEFAULT_CONTEXT_MESSAGES = 5` (was 10; aligned with zylos-lark's
    `DEFAULT_HISTORY_LIMIT`)
  - `DEFAULT_DEDUP_TTL_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000` (unchanged; matches lark's
    `MESSAGE_DEDUP_TTL_MS`)

  Behavior: `config.message.context_messages` / `config.message.dedup_ttl`
  are still honoured if set, but the `message` block can now be **omitted
  entirely** from `config.json`. Existing configs that include the block
  continue to work — values present in config still take precedence over
  the hardcoded defaults.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Reconnect catch-up**: `comm-bridge.js` now invokes `POST /api/v1/sync`
  after every successful WS open, pulling any conversation events
  (`{conversation_id, message_id, seq}`) with `seq > sessionRef.last_seq`
  and dispatching them through the normal message handler. Each event
  passes through the existing message dedupe, so a message that arrives
  via both WS and sync is processed once. First-ever connect with
  `last_seq=0` is a no-op. The sync sweep is bounded to 2000 events per
  open and paged at 100; further backlog is pulled on the next reconnect
  (or via the `comm.sync` CLI). Per-org `_syncInFlight` guard prevents
  overlapping sweeps from a rapid reconnect storm.

### Changed
- On WS close code `4003` (session expired), `last_seq` is now **preserved**
  (only the token cache is invalidated). Previous behavior wiped the
  org session entirely, defeating sync catch-up after a session expiry.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Project structure and directory layout
- Communication module: `comm-bridge.js` (WebSocket to C4 bridge) skeleton
